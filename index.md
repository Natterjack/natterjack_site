# Welcome

Natterjack is a statically typed programming language inspired by the power and flexibility of dynamically typed languages.

    class Hello
        // writes a greeting to the standard output
        void greet(String thing)
            IO.put("Hello #{thing}")
        end
    end

    Hello.new.greet("World!")

## Pinches of Salt

The language is very young at the moment.  It is likely to radically change direction as I work out what I want it to be and test out new features.  Use at your own peril.

## Getting Started

Natterjack lives on Bitbucket at <http://bitbucket.org/iwillspeak/natterjack>.  To compile from source you should just need a modern C++ compiler and Rake on a *nix machine.

Once you have the source downloaded you should be able to compile the main executable with `rake`.  To run the unit tests as well run `rake test`.

## Download

Natterjack is in the early stages of development at the moment and only available as source distribution.  To get a copy of the code you can clone the Git repository at `http://bitbucket.org/iwillspeak/natterjack`.

## Docs

Documentation is currently under development and can be found in the `/docs` directory at the root of the repository.
