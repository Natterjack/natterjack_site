	  <h1>Welcome</h1>

	  <p>Natterjack is a statically typed programming language inspired by the power and flexibility of dynamically typed languages.</p>

<pre><code>class Hello
    // writes a greeting to the standard output
    void greet(String thing)
        IO.put(&quot;Hello #{thing}&quot;)
    end
end

Hello.new.greet(&quot;World!&quot;)
</code></pre>

<h2>Pinches of Salt</h2>

	  <p>The language is very young at the moment.  It is likely to radically change direction as I work out what I want it to be and test out new features.  Use at your own peril.</p>

	  <h2>Getting Started</h2>

	  <p>Natterjack lives on Bitbucket at <a href="http://bitbucket.org/iwillspeak/natterjack">http://bitbucket.org/iwillspeak/natterjack</a>.  To compile from source you should just need a modern C++ compiler and Rake on a *nix machine.</p>

	  <p>Once you have the source downloaded you should be able to compile the main executable with <code>rake</code>.  To run the unit tests as well run <code>rake test</code>.</p>

	  <h2>Download</h2>

	  <p>Natterjack is in the early stages of development at the moment and only available as source distribution.  To get a copy of the code you can clone the Git repository at <code>http://bitbucket.org/iwillspeak/natterjack</code>.</p>

	  <h2>Docs</h2>

	  <p>Documentation is currently under development and can be found in the <code>/docs</code> directory at the root of the repository.</p>
